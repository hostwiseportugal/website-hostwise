    intro_text={`
      <p>
        The growth of tourist operation models outside traditional hospitality — such as entire buildings, serviced apartments and hybrid projects — requires a management approach different from classic property administration or conventional hotel management.
      </p>
      <p>
        These assets combine real estate scale with hospitality logic, which demands rigorous operational control, dynamic revenue strategy, efficient distribution and a strong technological foundation. Their complexity lies not only in daily operations, but in the need to align profitability, guest experience and long-term asset preservation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Serviced accommodation management thus emerges as a specialized solution for investors and owners who want to operate tourist buildings professionally, in a structured and performance-oriented manner.
