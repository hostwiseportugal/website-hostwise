      <p>
        The hotel market has become progressively more competitive, pressured by operational costs, dependence on intermediaries and changes in guest behaviour. Independent hotels, boutique hotels and hostels face challenges today that require more analytical, agile and data-driven management.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hotel asset management goes beyond daily operations. It involves strategic decisions about pricing, distribution, cost structure, market positioning and long-term asset appreciation.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is in this context that Host Wise acts as a management partner, combining operational experience, technology and a focus on performance.
